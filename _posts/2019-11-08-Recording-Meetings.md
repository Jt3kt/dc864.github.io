## The Meeting
December 5th at 6-9 (but we usually wrap up around 8:30)

Big twist this month.  The main portion of the meeting will showcase our geek gift list.  Bring your wish list of gotta have and wildest dream items for rapid fire show 'n tell.  If you actually have the item dazzle us otherwise we'll make due with hot swap sharing the screen.

The last half of the meeting will be an open forum to share the status of our current projects.  No pressure.  If you have a demo to share that's great but so is simply talking us through the project.  This is a free form time.  Typically it branches from projects into geek or nerd culture so buckle up.

Attendance is free and open to the public.
However the doors to Synergy Mill are locked.  We keep an eye out for folks at the door through about 7PM.  After 7 tag us in the monthly_meeting Slack channel and we'll let you in.

See you there!
