# CODE OF CONDUCT
1.	DC864 provides a platform that is open to anyone who wishes to meet, regardless of who they are or what walks of life they come from. Harassment of any sorts, including sexual harassment, or harassment based on someone’s race, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, disability, skills/experience, etc will not be tolerated. Anyone found to be harassing others, or have affiliations to hate groups, may be warned or removed from the group. TL;DR: Don’t be rude.

2.	Respect the privacy of others. Seek permission before photographing other individuals at meetings. If the subject asks, please delete any videos or photos you may have of them at a meeting. In the event that the DC864 is providing “Off the Record” accommodations for a speaker in advance, electronic recording of any sorts is strictly prohibited. During the talk, mobile devices must be stowed in your pocket or bag. Anyone suspected of recording will be asked to leave.

3.	The DC864 does not, nor does DEF CON® Groups, condone illegal activities. Some of the members of DC864 have worked against criminal actors in their careers. You DO NOT want to pop up on their radar. For your own sake, do not come to meet ups looking to hack other people or organizations.

4.	Academic/professional dishonesty is prohibited. Do not use the meetups or provided platforms to cheat on contests or coursework. Assistance and writeups are awesome. Removing the learning experience is not. Cheating will always get you “pwned” at the technical interview.

5.	Law Enforcement encouraged to contribute and participate in DC864 activities, given that they are open and honest about their affiliation and intentions.

6.	This Code of Conduct is not the exclusive rules of the group, but are guidelines as to how persons who take part in the DC864 are expected to conduct themselves. Persons may be banned for reasons that go beyond this Code of Conduct if they are found to be disruptive to how the group operates, or if their behavior poses a hazard to others.
